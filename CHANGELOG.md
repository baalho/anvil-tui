# Changelog

All notable changes to Anvil are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

## [v2.1.0] — 2025-07-17 — The Stability Update

### Fixed
- **Workspace bleed** — daemon socket path is now workspace-scoped via
  path hash (`daemon-<hash>.sock`). Multiple daemons can run concurrently
  in different project directories without collision.
- **IPC backpressure freezes** — `write_frame` in the connection handler
  is wrapped in a 3-second timeout. Slow or suspended clients are shed
  immediately, freeing the dispatch loop.
- **State tearing on crash** — new `turn_messages` table stores each
  `ChatMessage` as JSON incrementally during the turn (migration 003).
  `record_last_message()` is called after every `messages.push()`.
  Session resume prefers `turn_messages` over decomposed reconstruction.
- **Watcher ping-pong loop** — `WriteLedger` in `anvil-tools` tracks
  files modified by `file_write`/`file_edit` with their mtime. The file
  watcher checks incoming events against the ledger and suppresses the
  agent's own writes. External modifications (different mtime) pass through.

### Added
- `WriteLedger` type (`anvil-tools/src/ledger.rs`) — `Arc<RwLock<HashMap>>`
  shared between tool executor and file watcher.
- `Agent::set_write_ledger()` — injects the ledger from the binary crate.
- `SessionStore::append_turn_message()` / `load_turn_messages()` /
  `clear_turn_messages()` — incremental message persistence.
- 13 new tests (5 ledger, 5 turn_messages, 3 workspace-scoped sockets).

## [v2.0.0] — 2025-07-17 — The Asynchronous Daemon

### Added
- **Daemon mode** — `anvil daemon start` runs Anvil as a background
  server. Accepts prompts over Unix domain sockets (IPC). Socket bound
  at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/anvil/daemon.sock` (Linux) or
  `/tmp/anvil-$UID/daemon.sock` (macOS). PID file for lifecycle management.
  Graceful shutdown via `anvil daemon stop` or SIGINT/SIGTERM.
- **`anvil send`** — lightweight CLI client that connects to the daemon
  and streams responses. Content goes to stdout (pipe-friendly),
  diagnostics to stderr. Supports `-y` for auto-approve.
- **`anvil daemon status`** — shows session, model, mode, uptime, PID.
- **IPC wire protocol** — length-prefixed JSON over UDS. `Request` enum
  (Prompt, Status, Shutdown) and `Response` enum (Delta, Thinking,
  ToolPending, ToolResult, TurnComplete, Error, StatusInfo, Acknowledged).
  Max frame size 16 MB.
- **8 new tests** — IPC frame roundtrip, request/response serialization,
  EOF handling, socket path resolution.
- **Comprehensive MANUAL.md rewrite** — full onboarding guides for
  TurboQuant (262K context), MLX, daemon mode, and watch mode. Step-by-step
  setup for MacBook Pro M4 Max with llama-server + turbo4.

### Design Decision
- **Single binary architecture** — `anvil` is both daemon and client.
  No separate binaries, no process manager. `daemon start` runs in
  foreground; use nohup/systemd/launchd to background.
- **Sequential dispatch** — the daemon processes one prompt at a time.
  Additional requests queue in the mpsc channel. The agent is exclusively
  owned by the dispatch loop — no Arc/Mutex.
- **Zero changes to anvil-agent** — the v1.9 Event abstraction held.
  The daemon is a new event producer, not a new event consumer.

## [v1.9.0] — 2025-07-17 — Bridge to v2.0

### Added
- **Session snapshots** — `SessionSnapshot` persists agent state (mode,
  persona, active skills, model profile) to SQLite after every turn.
  `anvil --continue` now restores the full agent state, not just messages.
  New columns added via idempotent migration.
- **Event abstraction** — `Event` enum (`UserPrompt`, `FileChanged`,
  `Shutdown`) decouples trigger sources from agent logic. `dispatch_event()`
  routes any event to `agent.turn()` without knowing the source. In v2.0,
  adding a UDS listener requires zero changes to dispatch or agent code.
- **`anvil watch` command** — native file watcher using the `notify` crate.
  Monitors the workspace for file changes, debounces editor save storms
  (configurable, default 2s), filters noise (`.git/`, `target/`,
  `node_modules/`, swap files, hidden files), and triggers agent turns
  automatically. Supports `--ignore` patterns and `--debounce` interval.
- **22 new tests** — session snapshot roundtrip (6), event enum (3),
  dispatch prompt formatting (3), file watcher noise filtering (10).

### Fixed
- `anvil --profile` no longer panics when `Settings` is consumed by
  `Agent::new()` — now clones settings before passing to agent.
- Skill activation in launch profiles uses `SkillLoader::scan()` instead
  of nonexistent `load_all()` method.

### Design Decision
- **Stateless autonomy over daemon** — v1.9 builds the abstractions
  (Event enum, dispatch loop, session persistence) that v2.0 needs,
  without introducing IPC, process supervision, or socket management.
  Every line of v1.9 code is load-bearing in v2.0.

## [v1.8.0] — 2025-07-17 — BYOB TurboQuant & Ops Platform

### Added
- **TurboQuant KV cache profiles** — `KvCacheConfig` struct with `type_k`,
  `type_v`, and `recommended_context` fields. Two bundled profiles for
  Qwen3-Coder with turbo4 (262K context) and turbo3 (512K context).
  `recommended_context` overrides `context.default_window` when matched.
- **Zellij layouts** — three bundled KDL layouts written to
  `.anvil/layouts/` by `anvil init`:
  - `anvil-tq.kdl` — TurboQuant (llama-server + Anvil in split panes)
  - `anvil-dev.kdl` — development (Anvil + editor + shell)
  - `anvil-ops.kdl` — homelab operations (Anvil + SSH + logs)
- **`--zellij [layout]` CLI flag** — launches Anvil inside a Zellij
  session with the named layout. Detects `$ZELLIJ` to prevent nesting.
  Skips launch inside devcontainers.
- **Devcontainer detection** — `detect_devcontainer()` checks 4
  indicators (/.dockerenv, REMOTE_CONTAINERS, CODESPACES, /workspaces/
  prefix, devcontainer.json). Injects Layer 4d into system prompt.
- **Deployment skill** — `deploy.md` bundled skill for deploying
  services to inventory hosts using SOPS/age secrets and SSH.
- **Structured deployments in inventory** — `[[hosts.deployments]]`
  with `name`, `port`, `secrets`, and `compose_file` fields. Deployment
  details rendered in system prompt with runtime-specific commands.
- **KV cache info in `/model` and startup banner** — shows cache type
  and effective context when a TQ profile is matched.
- **`ModelProfile::effective_context()`** — returns `recommended_context`
  from `[kv_cache]` if present, otherwise `context.default_window`.

### Design Decision
- **BYOB (Bring Your Own Backend)** — Anvil does not manage inference
  server processes. Zellij layouts handle backend lifecycle. This follows
  the "prefer boring over clever" principle from AGENTS.md.

## [v1.7.0] — 2025-07-17 — MLX Hardening Edition

### Added
- **MLX tool_choice fallback** — when a backend rejects `tool_choice`
  with 400/422, the client retries once without it. MLX backends that
  don't support the parameter now work without manual configuration.
- **MLX Default model profile** — bundled profile matching
  `mlx-community` / `mlx_community` patterns with appropriate sampling
  defaults (temp 0.7, top_p 0.9, 128K max context).
- **Explicit MLX model discovery** — `/models` now uses the correct
  `/v1/models` endpoint for MLX backends instead of falling through
  to the generic path.
- **Project detection edge case tests** — monorepo with multiple
  markers, `compose.yaml` variant, npm default, yarn lock file.
- **Mode integration tests** — verify Creative mode omits tools,
  Coding mode includes tools, persona auto-sets mode.
- **Capability parsing tests** — verify all bundled profiles have
  capabilities, defaults to empty, TOML parsing roundtrip.

### Changed
- **Renderer pipeline completed** — all agent output now routes through
  the `Renderer` trait: thinking blocks, tool pending/result, command
  results, compaction messages. `interactive.rs` no longer imports
  crossterm directly for these operations.
- `render_tool_result()` signature decoupled from `ToolOutput` — takes
  icon, line count, and char count instead.
- Added `render_thinking_start()`, `render_thinking_end()`,
  `render_tool_pending()` to Renderer trait.

## [v1.6.0] — 2026-04-02 — Session Awareness Edition

### Added
- **Launch profiles** (`--profile` / `-p`) — bundle persona + mode +
  skills + model into a single CLI flag. `anvil -p sparkle` starts
  with Sparkle persona, creative mode, and kids skills in one command.
  Profiles defined in `[[profiles]]` section of `.anvil/config.toml`.
- **Last profile memory** — Anvil remembers the last-used profile and
  shows a hint on next launch: "last profile: sparkle (2 hours ago)".
- **Project auto-detection** — scans workspace for Cargo.toml,
  package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Makefile, Dockerfile, and
  docker-compose.yml. Injects project type into system prompt so the
  model knows the build system and test commands without being told.
- **`/selftest` command** — verifies all 8 tool categories work
  (file_write, file_read, file_edit, shell, ls, grep, find, git_status)
  without making any LLM calls. Quick health check when switching
  models or backends.
- **Conversation starters** — kids personas show 3 random suggestions
  after the greeting ("Try saying: 1. I like cats"). Typing a number
  sends the suggestion. Prevents blank-prompt freeze for young users.
- **Session summary on exit** — shows duration, tokens used, tools
  called, and files created. Kids personas get a celebratory summary
  ("You made 2 cool things!"), coding mode gets factual stats.
- **Example profiles in `anvil init`** — generated config.toml includes
  commented-out profile examples.

### Changed
- `/stats` shows mode.
- `/help` includes `/selftest` and `/mode`.
- Persona struct now includes `suggestions` field (8 per kids persona).

## [v1.5.0] — 2026-04-02 — Intent-Aware Edition

### Added
- **`tool_choice` parameter** — `ChatRequest` now sends `tool_choice`
  to the LLM API. Coding mode sends `"auto"` (model decides when to
  use tools), Creative mode sends `"none"` (model responds directly).
  This fixes the core issue where models would print code inline
  instead of using `file_write`.
- **Mode system** (`mode.rs`) — `Coding` and `Creative` modes control
  tool availability and response style. Coding mode sends all tools
  with `tool_choice: "auto"`. Creative mode omits tools entirely so
  the model responds directly (ASCII art, stories, explanations).
- **`/mode` slash command** — `/mode coding` or `/mode creative` to
  switch modes. `/mode` shows current mode. Personas auto-set mode:
  kids personas (sparkle, bolt, codebeard) → Creative, homelab → Coding.
- **Model profile capabilities** — `[capabilities]` section in model
  profiles with `strengths` tags (coding, creative, reasoning,
  tool-calling). Displayed by `/model` to help users pick the right
  model for their task.
- **Status line prompt** — prompt now shows `[mode|model]` with
  persona name when active. Mode icon: ⚒ for coding, ✨ for creative,
  persona-specific icons when a persona is active.
- **Renderer trait** (`render.rs`) — output rendering pipeline with
  `TerminalRenderer` implementation. Provides a seam for future
  renderers (image display, web UI) without touching agent logic.
- **`content_type` on ToolOutput::Structured** — hints the renderer
  about output format ("text", "image", "svg", "table"). Groundwork
  for future image generation support.
- **Tool-use guidance in system prompt** — explicit "When to Use Tools
  vs Respond Directly" section tells the model when to use `file_write`
  vs respond inline.

### Changed
- `/stats` now shows current mode.
- Banner shows mode at startup.
- All 9 bundled model profiles now include `[capabilities]` tags.

## [v1.4.0] — 2026-04-02 — Sparkle Edition

### Added
- **JSON extraction filter** (`json_filter.rs`) — regex-based extraction
  of JSON from persona-contaminated LLM output. Handles persona bleed
  where local models wrap tool call arguments in conversational text.
- **Kids sandbox** — config-driven `kids_workspace` path and shell
  command allowlist when a kids persona is active. Defense-in-depth:
  file tools resolve paths relative to the restricted workspace, and
  shell commands are checked against an allowlist before execution.
- **MCP zombie process prevention** — `McpManager` now implements
  `Drop` with `SIGKILL` cleanup. Child processes are spawned with
  `setsid()` so `kill(-pgid)` cleans up the entire process tree.
- **ToolOutput enum** — tools can return `Text` or `Structured` output.
  `Structured` carries both human-readable text (for LLM conversation)
  and machine-readable `serde_json::Value` (for future STEM rendering).
- **Input debouncing** — 2-second cooldown between user messages when a
  kids persona is active. Prevents button-mashing from flooding the
  agent with rapid-fire LLM requests.
- **System prompt layer contract test** — enforces the KV cache
  optimization ordering (static → dynamic) with a test that fails if
  layer order is violated.
- `/inventory` slash command — view hosts from `.anvil/inventory.toml`

### Changed
- `ToolExecutor::execute()` returns `ToolOutput` instead of `String`
- `AgentEvent::ToolResult` carries `ToolOutput` instead of `String`
- 15 slash commands (added `/inventory`)

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-04-02
